# CS263 - Runtime Systems

## Instructions
This github repo contains the code and the testing files for most of the tests utilized in the case study. However, it does not contain the k-means testing dataset as it's a part of the dataset that [Zhizhou Zhang] a research lab at UCSB utilizes and we do not have permission to share it openly. 

Each indidivual folder within research contains cpp/c code that can be compiled with your choice of compiler and then ran to be benchmarked.
